# GSoC 2026 – TL-Verilog Preparation

This repository documents my preparation for **Google Summer of Code 2026** with the **FOSSi Foundation** for the project:

**"Using AI to Improve Open-Source IP"**

Mentor: **Steve Hoover (Redwood EDA)**

The goal of this repository is to explore **TL-Verilog design methodology, Makerchip simulation workflows, and AI-assisted refactoring of open-source hardware IP**.

---

# Objective

The objective of this preparation work is to understand the technologies required for the project:

- TL-Verilog pipeline-based hardware design
- Makerchip IDE simulation environment
- Verilog → TL-Verilog refactoring workflows
- AI-assisted hardware code transformation
- Open-source RISC-V cores such as **SERV**

This repository contains **learning notes, experiments, and example designs** implemented while studying these technologies.

# TL-Verilog Examples

This repository includes several TL-Verilog design experiments implemented using Makerchip.

Examples include:

### Basic Designs
- ALU example
- basic TL-Verilog experiments

### Pipeline Designs
- simple pipeline example
- counter pipeline
- mini ALU pipeline

### RISC-V Experiments
- simple CPU model
- instruction decoder

These examples explore how **pipeline abstraction simplifies hardware design** compared to traditional RTL.

---

# Makerchip Experiments

All TL-Verilog examples are tested using **Makerchip Sandbox**.

Simulation links are documented in:
experiments/makerchip_links.md


Makerchip provides:

- pipeline visualization
- waveform debugging
- interactive hardware simulation

# Research Topics

This repository also explores research topics relevant to the GSoC project:

### Verilog → TL-Verilog Conversion
Study of automated refactoring workflows that convert traditional Verilog into TL-Verilog.

### AI-assisted Hardware Refactoring
Exploration of LLM-based agents capable of assisting in hardware code transformation.

# Future Work

Planned exploration includes:

- deeper analysis of open-source hardware IP
- experiments with Verilog → TL-Verilog refactoring
- investigation of AI-assisted hardware design tools
- potential contributions to relevant open-source repositories
