# GSoC 2026 – TL-Verilog Preparation

This repository documents my preparation for **Google Summer of Code 2026** with the **FOSSi Foundation** for the project:

**"Using AI to Improve Open-Source IP"**

Mentor: **Steve Hoover (Redwood EDA)**

The goal of this repository is to explore **TL-Verilog design methodology, Makerchip simulation workflows, and AI-assisted refactoring of open-source hardware IP**.

---

## Current Focus

- Learning TL-Verilog pipeline abstraction
- Understanding Makerchip simulation workflows
- Studying Verilog → TL-Verilog conversion methods
- Exploring AI-assisted hardware design tools

# TL-Verilog Examples

This repository includes several TL-Verilog design experiments implemented using Makerchip.

Examples include:

### Basic Designs
- ALU example
- basic TL-Verilog experiments

 Some files include Makerchip VIZ-based visualizations to demonstrate simple behaviors.

 
### Fundamental Designs
- register pipeline example
- shift register pipeline
- multi-stage arithmetic pipeline
- simple FSM experiment

These examples demonstrate core TL-Verilog concepts such as register behavior, stage-to-stage data propagation, control logic, and multi-stage pipeline computation.

### Pipeline Designs
- simple pipeline example
- counter pipeline
- mini ALU pipeline

These examples demonstrate TL-Verilog pipeline concepts such as stage separation and signal propagation.

### RISC-V Experiments
- simple CPU model
- instruction decoder
  
These experiments explore how TL-Verilog pipeline abstraction simplifies hardware design compared to traditional RTL approaches.

---

# Makerchip Experiments

All TL-Verilog examples are tested using **Makerchip Sandbox**.

Simulation links are documented in:
experiments/makerchip_links.md


Makerchip provides:

- pipeline visualization
- waveform debugging
- interactive hardware simulation
